        <h2>What's it About?</h2>
        <p>Fortnite is a Battle Royal style game that throws 100 players into an large open world map, to fight, loot, and make it to the center of the circle before the time runs down and the storms rolls in. There are no repawns in game so it is truly a battle of wits and strategy to take te victory royal. The design of the game is a third person catoon-like shooter, which despite controversal beliefs, is a family friendly and cartoon like experience, as it shows no blood and gore. Though, the game is still intense and is always an exciting and sometime scary shooter. </p>
